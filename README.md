## Download/Install


### Download binaries

- The latest binary executables are available right under the github release page  
https://github.com/AntonioSun/xmlfmt/releases  
as the result of the Continuous-Integration process.
- I.e., they are built during every git tagged push, automatically by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), right from the source code, truely WYSIWYG.
- The `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.apk` packages are readily available, as well as the executables for other Linux and Windows as well.
- Pick & choose the binary executable that suits your OS and its architecture. E.g., for Linux, it would most probably be the `xmlfmt_ver_linux_amd64.tar.gz` file.
- Unzip it and put the executable somewhere in the PATH, after downloading it.
